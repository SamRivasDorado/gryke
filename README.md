# gryke
A simple set of functions which applies the classic structural geology concept of area balance (Chamberlin, 1909) to a set of input parameters which describe a graben, and which is assumed to be formed due to dike intrusion. The core function, gryke, returns a series of dike and fault parameters which allow to model the subsurface geometry of the system.

The calculations applied by the gryke core function are explained in detail in the paper 'Subsurface Geometry and Emplacement Conditions of a Giant Dike System in Elysium Fossae, Mars' (Article ID: JGRE_21554. Article DOI: 10.1029/2020JE006512).
