# gryke
A simple set of functions which applies the classic structural geology concept of area balance (Chamberlin, 1909) to a set of input parameters which describe a graben, which is assumed to be formed due to dike intrusion. The core function, gryke, returns a series of dike and fault parameters which allow to model the subsurface geometry of the intrusion in a cross section.

The calculations applied by the gryke core function are explained in detail in the paper 'Subsurface Geometry and Emplacement Conditions of a Giant Dike System in Elysium Fossae, Mars' (https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2020JE006512).
