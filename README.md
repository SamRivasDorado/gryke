# gryke
A simple set of functions which applies the classic structural geology concept of area balance (Chamberlin, 1909) to a set of input parameters which describe a graben, and which is assumed to be formed due to dike intrusion. The core function, gryke, returns a series of dike and fault parameters which allow to model the subsurface geometry of the system.
